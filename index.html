        <h3>
          Our mission is to save the lives of Greyhounds.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to reducing the routine wastage by promoting awareness about the welfare of Greyhounds. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We advocate their suitability as companion dogs for a wide range of homes. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Through a continued program of promotion and education. Friends of the hound Inc. has focused on dispelling misconceptions and changing the perception of the breed from being "just a race dog".
        </p>
        <p>
          The organisation works tirelessly to rescue Greyhounds and adopt them into suitable, permanent homes as family pets and companions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It's all about the dogs!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Our dream is to have our own Greyhound Adoption Centre. 
        </h3>
        <p>
          As you can appreciate, a shortage of funds and hands on help afflict most charitable voluntary organisations. Friends of the hound is a small group, operating over a large geographical area that does not fit in to the categories of most mainstream charities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need a place to set up as a haven for rescued Greyhounds (in-home style, not just kennels), where dogs can be housed safely and the business of adoption and promotion carried out effectively. This would greatly improve on the current successful but limited rescue, fostering and homig efforts, so that mopre beautiful dogs can be saved. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hound Haven project needs help to transform from a dream to a much-needed reality. Donations are greatly appreciated. *Button saying donate below*
