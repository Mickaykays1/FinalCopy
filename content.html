  Our mission is to save the lives of Greyhounds.
  </h3>

    <p>
      We are dedicated to reducing the routine wastage by promoting awareness about the welfare of Greyhounds. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We advocate their suitability as companion dogs for a wide range of homes. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Through a continued program of promotion and education. Friends of the hound Inc. has focused on dispelling misconceptions and changing the perception of the breed from being "just a race dog".
    </p>
    <p>
      The organisation works tirelessly to rescue Greyhounds and adopt them into suitable, permanent homes as family pets and companions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's all about the dogs!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Our dream is to have our own Greyhound Adoption Centre. 
    </h3>
    <p>
      As you can appreciate, a shortage of funds and hands on help afflict most charitable voluntary organisations. Friends of the hound is a small group, operating over a large geographical area that does not fit in to the categories of most mainstream charities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need a place to set up as a haven for rescued Greyhounds (in-home style, not just kennels), where dogs can be housed safely and the business of adoption and promotion carried out effectively. This would greatly improve on the current successful but limited rescue, fostering and homig efforts, so that mopre beautiful dogs can be saved. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hound Haven project needs help to transform from a dream to a much-needed reality. Donations are greatly appreciated. *Button saying donate below*

    <h3>
      Are Greyhounds High Energy Active Dogs?
    </h3>

    <p>
      This is one of the most common misconceptions about this breed. Greyhounds are bred and exploited as racing dogs for their natural speed and ability, however off the track they are docile, gentle, and friendly animals who love human attention and companionship and are known to be quite lazy. Often described as the ’60km/hour couch potato’ Greyhounds like to spend much of their time relaxing or sleeping, and they love comfort. They are low-energy, low-maintenance dogs that only require regular, short walks to keep them happy and healthy
    </p>

    <h3>
      Do Greyhounds Make Good Indoor Pets?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Greyhounds are low-energy dogs that love human companionship. Their calm and quiet nature, combined with their relaxed and sedentary behaviour make them perfect indoor pets. Minimal shedding, a distinct lack of doggy-odour, and an aristocratic appreciation of the good life supports such indoor privileges. Greyhounds love to be part of the family and are grateful for ‘creature comforts’ and are very well-suited to indoor life. It is the preferred situation for them.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Are Greyhounds able to live with small animals?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Greyhounds are sighthounds, whose natural prey is the hare. Greyhounds are encouraged to chase as racing dogs. Some Greyhounds have too strong an instinct to chase – or ‘prey drive’ – to live with small animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some Greyhounds are able to live in harmony with small, furry animals. Friends of the Hounds Inc. has rehomed many Greyhounds, including ex-racers, to homes with small dogs, cats, chickens, ducks, pet rats, guinea pigs and even rabbits. Dogs with a low prey drive, or non-chasers, or those that have successfully ‘let-down’ in their retraining can often live happily with other animals.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Do Greyhounds Require a Large Yard?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Greyhounds do not require a large yard. They are very suitable pets for high-density suburban areas as they are quiet, docile and adaptable. Surprisingly, these sleek, sinewy, stylish hounds do not require a lot or room or excessive exercise, being quite content with regular short walks. Short bursts of energy and long bouts of lethargy typify the Greyhound’s character, and they can often live happily in homes with a small backyard or courtyard (this is apparent when you consider that they are routinely kept in small cages or kennels by racing owners and trainers).
    </p>

    <p>
      Greyhounds do enjoy occasional “zoomies” – running a couple of laps around the yard, lasting only a few minutes, before returning to their bed!

    </p>

    <p>
      Greyhounds are often recommended for those living in townhouses, duplexes or apartments due to their quiet, calm and sedentary nature, but there are certain requirements to ensure a happy hound.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Do Grehounds Require a Coat for Winter?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Greyhounds have no undercoat and very short hair. They also have little body fat to insulate them from either the heat of summer or the cold of winter. The rule of thumb is that if it is cool enough for you to need a jacket or coat, it is cool enough for your Greyhound to need one too. Greyhounds tend to love wearing their coats on cold, winter nights.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Greyhounds also do not tolerate heat as well as other dogs of their build and coat type; even if all your Greyhound does is loll in the yard on a hot summer day, you must provide shade and plenty of cool water to prevent heatstroke. Small, wading pools can provide relief from summer heat.
      </p>
    
    <h3>
      Are Greyhounds Good With Children?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The question should also be asked “Are your children good with dogs?”
    </p>

    <p>
      A placid and tolerant dog, Greyhounds are generally good with children.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, their calm and sensitive nature, combined with their relaxed and easy-going behaviour, make them highly suited as pets-as-therapy dogs and suitable as companions for people of all ages, including young children and older members of the community.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with all dogs, it is recommended that children are supervised at all times when interacting with the Greyhound.
